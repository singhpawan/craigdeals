Suspend or revoke access for compromised users and roles.
Implement temporary security controls, such as network restrictions or data masking.
4. Eradication:

Remove malicious code or configurations.
Reset compromised passwords and credentials.
Restore data from backups or snapshots.
5. Recovery:

Bring affected systems and data back online.
Monitor systems for any signs of recurring activity.
Restore normal operations.
6. Post-Incident Activity:

Conduct a post-incident review to identify root causes and lessons learned.
Update incident response procedures based on findings.
Implement preventive measures to reduce the risk of similar incidents in the future.
Additional considerations for Snowflake:

Utilize Snowflake's security features, such as access control, data encryption, and network security, to enhance incident response capabilities.
Leverage Snowflake's audit logs and query history to investigate incidents and identify suspicious activity.
Consider using Snowflake's data replication and failover capabilities to minimize downtime during incidents.
Stay informed about Snowflake security advisories and updates to address potential vulnerabilities.
