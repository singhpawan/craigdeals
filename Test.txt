This is a great follow-up question, as it gets to the core of the trade-offs beyond just PCI compliance. Let's break down those additional factors you mentioned, and how they influence the single vs. multiple Snowflake account decision:

1. Security Blast Radius:

Single Account: A single account represents a larger attack surface. If compromised, the potential damage is greater as all data within the account is at risk. Even with granular access controls, a breach could lead to wider exposure.
Multiple Accounts: Multiple accounts limit the blast radius. If one account is compromised, the impact is contained to that specific account and its data. This is a significant advantage from a security perspective.
2. Platform Administration Overhead:

Single Account: A single account simplifies some administrative tasks. There's one set of users, roles, and configurations to manage. However, this can become complex as the number of users and data assets grows, requiring intricate access controls and potentially leading to "super-user" issues.
Multiple Accounts: Multiple accounts increase the initial administrative overhead. You have separate user management, role definitions, and security configurations for each account. However, this can be mitigated with automation tools and Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) practices. It also allows for more delegation of administration to LoB-specific teams.
3. Resource Contention and Performance:

Single Account: In a single account, different workloads from various LoBs can compete for resources (virtual warehouses). This can lead to performance bottlenecks, especially if one LoB has unpredictable or bursty usage patterns.
Multiple Accounts: Multiple accounts provide better workload isolation. Each LoB can have its own dedicated virtual warehouses, ensuring that their performance is not impacted by other workloads. This is crucial for maintaining consistent and predictable performance.
4. Data Governance and Compliance (Beyond PCI):

Single Account: With a single account, it can be more challenging to enforce strict data governance policies across different LoBs, especially if they have varying data sensitivity levels or regulatory requirements (even beyond PCI).
Multiple Accounts: Multiple accounts provide clearer boundaries for data ownership and responsibility. This simplifies data governance and compliance efforts, as each LoB can manage its data according to its specific policies and regulations.
5. Development Lifecycle (SDLC):

Single Account: Managing separate development, testing, and production environments within a single account can be complex and risky. It requires meticulous naming conventions, access controls, and deployment processes to avoid accidental data corruption or production issues.
Multiple Accounts: Separate accounts for SDLC environments (dev, test, prod) are highly recommended. This provides better isolation, reduces the risk of errors, and simplifies CI/CD pipelines.
6. Data Sharing and Collaboration:

Single Account: Data sharing within a single account is relatively straightforward. However, sharing data between LoBs might still require careful access control configurations to maintain data security and governance.
Multiple Accounts: Sharing data between accounts requires Snowflake's Secure Data Sharing feature. While this provides strong security and governance controls, it adds some complexity to the data sharing process.
7. Cost Management:

Single Account: It can be challenging to allocate costs accurately to different LoBs within a single account, especially if they share resources.
Multiple Accounts: Multiple accounts provide better cost transparency and allow for more granular cost allocation to each LoB.
Considering these factors, here's how they might influence your decision (assuming no PCI):

Strongly consider separate accounts if:
Your LoBs have significantly different security requirements or data sensitivity levels.
You need strong workload isolation to ensure predictable performance for each LoB.
Your LoBs have distinct data governance or compliance requirements.
You want to minimize the security blast radius in case of a compromise.
A single account might be acceptable if:
Your LoBs have very similar security needs and data sensitivity levels.
Their workloads are relatively predictable and unlikely to cause resource contention.
You have a very strong data governance framework and are confident in your ability to enforce it within a single account.
You are willing to accept a potentially larger security blast radius.
Important Note: Even with a single account, you'll still need to implement robust security measures, including:

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Define granular roles and permissions to restrict data access based on user needs.
Data Masking and Row-Level Security: Implement masking and row-level security to protect sensitive data.
Auditing and Monitoring: Monitor user activity and data access to detect and respond to potential threats.
Ultimately, the decision depends on your specific needs and priorities. Carefully weigh the trade-offs between simplicity and security, and choose the approach that best aligns with your organization's risk tolerance and data governance requirements.
